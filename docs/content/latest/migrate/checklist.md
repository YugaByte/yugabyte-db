This page describes the general migration process from various RDBMS to YugabyteDB (YSQL API). 


{{< note title="Effort to migrate" >}}

**Migrating from PostgreSQL:** Migrating an application from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB YSQL should be very straightforward. This is because YugabyteDB is feature-compatible with PostgreSQL v11.2 to a large degree.

**Migrating from other RDBMS:** In the case of RDBMS than PostgreSQL, the effort to migrate to YugabyteDB is very similar to the effort in migrating to PostgreSQL.
