[Rook](https://rook.io) is an open source, cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support that can turn YugaByte DB clusters into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. Rook automates storage-layer tasks, including deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management.

The [Rook YugaByte DB Operator](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.1/yugabytedb.html) is a custom controller that uses Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to extend the Kubernetes API and automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugaByte DB clusters.  Based on the  _desired state_ that you specified in the CRD, the Rook operator observes (watching for changes in state and health), analyzes (comparing current to desired state), and acts (applying changes to the cluster) to maintain the desired state. For details, see [YugaByte DB Cluster CRD](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.1/yugabytedb-cluster-crd.html)

## Before you begin

A YugaByte DB cluster installed in a Kubernetes environment is required. If 

- To create a local cluster in Kubernetes for development and learning, see [Quick start](https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/quick-start/).
- To deploy a production cluster, see the YugaByte DB documentation on [deploying in  Kubernetes](../kubernetes/)

Verify that your Kubernetes cluster is ready for Rook by reviewing the [Kubernetes cluster prerequisites for using the Rook operator](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/Documentation/k8s-pre-reqs.md).

Rook must be installed â€” see  the [Rook GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rook/rook). You can install Rook by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rook/rook.git
```

## Deploy the Rook YugaByte DB operator

To deploy the YugaByte DB operator, 

1. Change your directory to the Rook directory containing the YugaByte DB example files.

    ```bash
    cd cluster/examples/kubernetes/yugabytedb
    ```

2. Create the Rook YugaByte DB operator by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f operator.yaml
    ```

3. Observe the Rook operator by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n rook-yugabytedb-system get pods
    ```

## Create the YugaByte DB Cluster CRD

When using the Rook YugaByte DB operator, your YugaByte DB clusters are controlled using the custom resource object (`ybclusters.yugabytedb.rook.io`). The Custom Resource Definition (CRD), used to create this object, is specified in the `cluster.yaml` file.  

A sample Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file, called `cluster.yaml`, is located in the following Rook directory:

```bash
cluster/examples/kubernetes/yugabytedb
```

Make a copy of the sample CRD file (`cluster.yaml`)  and modify it as needed. For details on the configuration options, see [YugaByte DB CRD](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.1/yugabytedb-cluster-crd.html).

## Create a simple YugabyteDB cluster

1. Create your YugabyteDB cluster by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f cluster.yaml
    ```

2. Verify that the custom resource object was created by using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n rook-yugabytedb get ybclusters.yugabytedb.rook.io
    ```

3. Verify that the number of YB-Master and YB- TServer services that are running match the number you specified in the `cluster.yaml` file by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n rook-yugabytedb get pods
    ```

## Use YugaByte DB

When all of the pods in YugaByte DB cluster are running, you can use the YSQL shell to access the YSQL API, which is PostgreSQL-compliant.

```console
kubectl exec -it yb-tserver-rook-yugabytedb-0 /home/yugabyte/bin/ysqlsh -- -h yb-tserver-rook-yugabytedb-0  --echo-queries
```

For details on the YSQL API, see:

- [Explore Yugabyte SQL (YSQL)](https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/quick-start/explore-ysql/#kubernetes) in the Quick Start section
- [YugaByte Structured Query Language (YSQL)](https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/api/ysql/)

## Cleanup

Run the commands below to clean up all resources created above.

**NOTE:** This will destroy your database and delete all of its data.

```console
kubectl delete -f cluster.yaml
kubectl delete -f operator.yaml
```

Manually delete any Persistent Volumes that were created for this YugabyteDB cluster.

## Troubleshooting

### Review the operator logs

If the cluster does not start,  run following command to take a look at operator logs.

```bash
kubectl -n rook-yugabytedb-system logs -l app=rook-yugabytedb-operator

```

### Review the YugaByte DB logs

If everything is OK in the operator logs, check the YugabyteDB Master & TServer logs.

```bash
kubectl -n rook-yugabytedb logs -l app=yb-master-rook-yugabytedb
kubectl -n rook-yugabytedb logs -l app=yb-tserver-rook-yugabytedb

```
