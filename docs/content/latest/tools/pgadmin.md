## About pgAdmin

[pgAdmin](https://pgadmin.org) is an open source administration and management tool for PostgreSQL database. Because YugabyteDB is PostgreSQL-compatible, you can also use pgAdmin to work with YugabyteDB.

PgAdmin is a commonly used database management tool in the PostgresDB community. It simplifies the creation, maintenance, and use of database objects by offering a clean and intuitive user interface. PgAdmin is packed with a rich set of features to manage databases including a simple to use connection wizard, built-in SQL editor to import SQL scripts, and a mechanism to auto-generate SQL scripts if you need to run them on the database command line shell. The GUI is very clean and you can get accustomed to it in no time. You can run PgAdmin through the web interface, or as a downloadable app that is locally installed.
