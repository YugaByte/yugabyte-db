## Background
The database is a larger application, needs to consume a lot of memory CPU, IO, and network resources. SQL optimization is one of the methods of database optimization. First of all, we must understand the most resource-consuming SQL, namely TOP SQL. The pg_stat_statements module provides a means for tracking planning and execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server. If you use yugabyte and you havenâ€™t yet used pg_stat_statements, it is a must to add it to your toolbox. And even if you are familiar, it may be worth a revisit.

## Install pg_stat_statements

It is installed by default.

##  Load the pg_stat_statements module

In  `var/var/data/pg_data/postgresql.conf` of yugabyte home directory,  the `hared_preload_libraries` configration parameters should be modified.

```sql
yugabyte=# show shared_preload_libraries;
         shared_preload_libraries         
------------------------------------------
 pg_stat_statements,yb_pg_metrics,pgaudit
(1 row)
```
If you want to track IO elapsed time, you also need to turn on the following parameters  in `postgresql.conf`

```shell
track_io_timing = on
```

Set the maximum length of a single SQL to exceed the truncated display (optional) in `postgresql.conf`, for example:

```shell
track_activity_query_size = 2048 
```

## Configure the pg_stat_statements sampling parameters in postgresql.conf, for example:

```shell
pg_stat_statements.max = 10000      
pg_stat_statements.track = all 
pg_stat_statements.track_utility = off  
pg_stat_statements.save = on  
```

## Create pg_stat_statements extension

```sql
yugabyte=# drop extension pg_stat_statements;
DROP EXTENSION
yugabyte=# create extension pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

## Restart yugabyte database

```shell
$ yugabyted start
```

## Analyze the TOP SQL

```sql
yugabyte=# \d pg_stat_statements;
                    View "public.pg_stat_statements"
