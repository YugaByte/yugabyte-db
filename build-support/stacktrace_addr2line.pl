Usage: $0 executable [stack-trace-file]

This script will read addresses from a file containing stack traces and
will convert the addresses that conform to the pattern "  0x123456" to line
numbers by calling addr2line on the provided executable.
If no stack-trace-file is specified, it will take input from stdin.
