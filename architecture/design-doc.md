# Goals

YugaByteDB is a unified database purpose-built to power modern, distributed cloud services. 

A distributed cloud services need a **distributed database** if one of the following is true:
- need scale out in order to handle high QPS (queries per second)
- the data set is large enough that scaling up one machine is not viable
- the data needs to be geo-replicated

YugaByte was built with the following design goals:
- **highly scalable**
- **highly resilient**
- **very performant**
- **cloud-native**
- **no dependence on external systems**

In order to support the needs of a wide array of distributed cloud services without imposing the necessity to learn a new API, YugaByte can be accessed using one or more of the following APIs on top of a common data fabric underneath:
- **Redis** APIs
- **Cassandra** Query Language (CQL)
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL - in progress)


# Features needed to build distributed cloud services

## Operational features needed
- **High scalability** Add or remove nodes at any time to increase the aggregate CPU, RAM or storage capacity of the serving cluster
- **Fault tolerance** Should be able to tolerate failures with minimal downtime and without external intervention
- **Highly resilient** When long-lasting errors happen, the database should re-replicate the data and satisfy the user intent
- **Intent based deployment** Changes to configuration may happen frequently, these changes should be auto-enforced without any application or service outage

## Database features needed

The figure above summarizes the core database features needed to build modern distributed cloud service (and those that are not).

The necessary features needed to build distributed cloud services are:
- **Strong consistency** This refers to *single row ACID* transactions, where consistency is enforced for a single key.
- **Consistent secondary Indexes** Maintain secondary indexes on some pre-defined set of columns or attributes, and query them efficiently.
- **Multi-row ACID transactions** Allow operations that insert, update or delete multiple rows with transactional semantics
- **Multi-DC deployments** Maintain the configured number of copies of the data across multiple geographies, and keep the data consistent and resilient even if failure are encountered
- **JSON / document support in DB** A lot applications need to store objects which have a variable set of attributes, and allow operations such as secondary indexes and filtering on these
- **Tunable read consistency** Allow timeline-consistent reads from followers or read-replicas, especially ability to read from a nearby datacenter
- **Expiring older data with TTLs** Allow data to be expired after a certain time interval, for example deleting the raw timeseries data points 1 year after they are written
- **High write throughput** Ability to perform efficient batch operations, especially writes
- **Run Apache Spark for AI/ML** Should be able to work with a real-time analytics system such as Spark Streaming, which is very useful services that depend on machine learning to expose interesting information to end-users

## Database features NOT needed

1. In a scale out architecture, nodes are typically added to improve performance. By choosing a service architecture which causes the performance of the system as a whole to degrade with the addition of nodes, we have defeated the purpose of scale-out distributed cloud service. The following features cause performance degradation on scaling out:
    - Foreign key constraints
    - Distributed joins

2. Eventual consistency does not work when building distributed, user-facing services because of the need for consistent responses. Hence the following feature is removed from the list:
    - Eventual consistency on writes

Note that master-slave async replication (which has timeline consistency) as well as reading from followers/read-replicas are not excluded, and these do not fall under eventual consistency.


# Architecture

## Overview

In terms of the traditional CAP theorem, YugaByteDB is a CP database (consistent and partition tolerant), but achieves very high availability. The architectural design of YugaByte is similar to Google Cloud Spanner, which is also a CP system. YugaByteDB has no single points of failure.

A YugaByte cluster, also referred to as a universe, is a group of nodes (VMs, physical machines or containers) that collectively function as a highly available and resilient database. A YugaByte universe can be deployed in a variety of configurations depending on business requirements, and latency considerations. Some examples:
- Single availability zone (AZ/rack/failure domain)
- Multiple AZs in a region
- Multiple regions (with synchronous and asynchronous replication choices)


Every YugaByteDB node is comprised of 2 layers:

- **YBase** This is the core data fabric. It is a highly available, distributed system with strong write consistency, tunable read consistency, and an advanced log-structured row/document-oriented storage. It includes several optimizations for handling ever-growing datasets efficiently. 

- **YQL** is the upper/edge layer that has the API specific aspects - for example, the server-side implementation of Apache Cassandra Query Language and Redis protocols, and the corresponding query/command compilation and run-time (data type representations, built-in operations, etc.).
